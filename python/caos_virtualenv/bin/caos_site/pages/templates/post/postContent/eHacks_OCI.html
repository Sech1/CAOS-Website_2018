        <p class="lead">We were proud to sponsor {eHacks}, a hackathon in which teams of students competed to build innovative digital products over the course of 36 hours.</p>

        <p>Prizes were awarded for the best creations in seven categories: overall winner (most innovative), most ambitious, best use of data, best mobile app, best UX, best game, and best educational program.</p>

        <p>The Hackathon began March 2nd at 5:00 p.m. in the T-REX building on Washington Avenue. For 36 hours, student teams devised plans, wrote code, integrated systems, and ultimately prepared for the final judgment on Sunday at 11:00 a.m.</p>

        <p>On March 4, 2018, 24 sleep-deprived student teams applied the final touches to their hack projects as a team of judges prepared to make its rounds.</p>

        <p>With no theme or specific problem to solve, teams had the freedom to create whatever they desired. Some teams took a functional approach, creating apps that calculate blood alcohol concentration levels and help music students learn to play piano by ear. Other projects were strictly for fun,
            including a 2D space shooter game and a Gameboy Guitar Hero-esque game built on 8-bit Assembly software.</p>

        <p>Winning students walked away from the weekend with Chromebooks, Amazon Firesticks, Echo Spots, portable SSDs, and more. But not only the prize winners came out on top â€“ all students left with impressive projects, a sense of pride for a job well done, and bright futures.</p>
