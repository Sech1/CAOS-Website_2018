    <p class="lead">It's finally happening, were putting together a group-buy for the CAOS t-shirts and hoodies, and as
        you've hopefully
        noticed, we also made hats (highly requested).
        We're going to be selling these as part of a group buy, so you'll fill out the google form, and once we get
        sufficent numbers I will email
        out paypal invoice forms to those who filled out the Google form. Those of you who end up paying the form will
        get your items.</p>
    <p>So to break it down, here's the basic instructions:
    <ol>
        <li>Fill out the google form.</li>
        <ul>To fill out the form, select the sizes <b>only on the items you're interested in.</b> Then select the
            quantity.
            Items for sale
            will be hats, t-shirts, and hoodies (zip and no zip)
        </ul>
        <li>In a month or so once we have received enough orders, we will close the form and send out Paypal invoices to
            all of those
            who submitted a google form, users will have a week or two to pay the invoice.
        </li>
        <ul>Those who do not pay, obviously will not receive items.</ul>
        <li>Shipping will be handled in person, we will get the clothing made and will likely deliver it to you on
            campus. If for some
            reason you cannot meet on campus (you aren't a student) or need items shipped through mail, please make a
            note of this
            in the special instructions section of the google form and we will have to work out accommodations
        </li>
        <ul>If you need an item shipped through mail, you will have to pay postage.</ul>
    </ol></p>

    <p>If you've read all the instructions and details and are still interested please fill out the google form
        below:<br>
        <b><span style="font-size: large;"><a class="bodyLink" href="https://goo.gl/forms/25kPSst9Q504Q4LP2"
