    <p class="lead">More than 30 high school students from across the region developed their own computer program during
        the Southern
        Illinois University Edwardsville School of Engineering’s (SOE) WeCode event on Saturday, April 21.</p>

    <p>Hosted by the SOE Department of Computer Science, participants from Edwardsville, Greenfield, Alton,
        Jerseyville, Waterloo, O’Fallon, Carrollton, Belleville and more learned computer programming through
        collaborative problem solving and building. About half of the students had never programmed before.</p>

    <p>To create their computer program, they used Snap, an online programming environment hosted by the University of
        California Berkeley. Snap is used in some computer science AP courses and college courses.</p>

        <span>“Computer science is a growing field with an increasing variety of career opportunities, We were glad to offer
              these high school students a chance to engage in a programming project while receiving mentorship from
              SIUE students.”</span>

    <p>Helping participants during WeCode was Dennis Bouvier, PhD, associate professor of computer science.“Our
        participants created some wonderful applications during our WeCode event, and I think we succeeded in giving
        them the tools to continue learning programming on their own.”</p>

    <p>Bouvier, and SIUE computer science students Eli Ball, Meg Heisler, Taylor Dowdy, Jared Schooley and Justin Bruce,
        assisted participants during the event.</p>

    <p>Event sponsors included Centene Corporation, AT&T, NiSC, OCI, Enterprise Holdings, T-REX, BJ’s
        Printables and SIUE.</p>
